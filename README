This repository contains utils for preconfiguring a yocto image that already contains k3s to run k3s-agent automatically at startup and connect to a predefined rancher server.

Modify `recipes-k3s/k3s-config/files/config.yaml` to configure the k3s agent with the correct token and rancher server. Additional config options can also be included there.
